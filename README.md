# Kotlin Map Function and Null Safety

This example demonstrates how Kotlin's `map` function behaves with null and nullable lists.  The primary concern is how it manages null values within the list itself and also when the list is null.

The `BuggyMap.kt` file contains code illustrating this handling. The `FixedMap.kt` demonstrates a solution using the safe call operator and null checks to avoid potential `NullPointerExceptions`.

This is a common issue for developers new to Kotlin's null safety features.
